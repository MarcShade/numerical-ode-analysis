# Comparison of different methods of numerical solutions to differential equations
## Usage
- Run the program with `python main.py`. 
## Results
There will be 2 main output files `euler.csv` and `rungekutta.csv`:
- `euler.csv`: Contains results from **Euler's method**.
- `rungekutta.csv`: Contains results from the **Runge-Kutta method (RK4)**.

Each row follows the structure: [t<sub>n</sub>], [approximate_y]
- The first column represents the independant variable t<sub>n</sub>, which increases with stepsize h for each iteration.
- The second column is the numerical approximation of the value of the solution at t<sub>n</sub> using the corresponding method.

There will be 2 files containing the accuracy metrics for each approximation point calculated by the respective numerical method:
- `euler_accuracy.csv`: Accuracy of **Eulerâ€™s method** at each step.
- `rungekutta_accuracy.csv`: Accuracy of the **Runge-Kutta (RK4)** method at each step.

Each row follows the structure:[t<sub>n</sub>], [accuracy_score]
- The first column matches the step indicator used in the main result CSVs.
- The second column is an accuracy score comparing the numerical result to the explicit analytical solution.
## Interpretation
After using my program you should:
- Consider plotting the data from the accuracy metric files in a software like GeoGebra for a cool visualisation!
- Compare the quality of the approximation to the amount of data produced within the designated timespan, why do you think RK4 is so widely used?
- Try varying the stepsize (h) and see how that has different impacts on the different methods.
